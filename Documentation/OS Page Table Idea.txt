1. The bits 0-11 of a virtual address name a byte in a page
2. Bits 12-21 name a page
3. Bits 22-31 name a page block (1024 pages)
4. The page table has two layers: a 1024-entry upper layer that holds addresses to lower layer or NULL if lower layer is not allocated
5. Lower layer page tables can be allocated or freed at will and have 1024 page entries

This makes page lookups roughly O(1) instead of O(N)
