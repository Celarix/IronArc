IronArc
=======

A virtual machine built upon a custom processor architecture.  Not intended for serious use.

IronArc is a program that emulates a virtual machine that uses an entirely new processor architecture. It will be built in C# against the .Net framework 4.0.

This program is not intended, nor will it ever be, for serious or production use. I take no responsibility for data loss from usage of this software. This is a project meant for enjoyment and education.
